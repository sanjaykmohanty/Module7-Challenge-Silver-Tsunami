# Module7 Challenge - Silver Tsunami

## Overview
A large number of employees will be retiring from Pewlett Hackard in next few years. The managers need to prepare for the **siver tsunami**.

The technical analysis report primarily answers the following questions:
1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

In addition, the report covers the following: 
- The roles need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins
- The number of qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees
